# TP Feedback for Team 10
                                        
**TP Grade**: B+
                                        
## Immersion Design
articulated design that targets specific user experiences that relates well to immersion concepts
                                        
## Immersion Implementation
implementation is clearly related to immersion design and works well
                                        
## Evaluation Method
appropriate data collection method was performed but lacks quantity and/or quality
                                        
## Evaluation Analysis
data was only somewhat analysed briefly to form conclusions
                                        
## Documentation
a comprehensive README (clear/detailed instructions and architecture) and a well-made video demo (well-scripted articulations with good footages)
                                        
## Software Engineering
minimal evidence of properly managed software development processes as a team
                                        
## Other feedback
The background music is too loud, making it hard to hear the commentary. The team describes the design to increase the realness of the environment. However, the textures do not feel realistic, and the classroom and the tables are too small.

The data collection method was actually decent as it somewhat related to the immersion concepts taught in class, however, the analysis falls short as it discussed concepts somewhat disjoint to what the data exhibited and only had little focus on immersion.

Documentation - very nice and efficient.
Software engineering - minimal evidence of task distribution and management shown in the short docx and minimal commit activities.
